# Surillya

I'm Surillya, founder of Surillya Entertainment and the brands associated with it. I'm quite the rookie, ngl, so if you see my repos, expect some horrible and unoptimized coding. But I'm always open to learn, so in such case feel free to open issues in said repositories going over the optimization possible; or open a PR! Would gladly apprechiate it.

I'm making music, mostly EDM and Alternative, so you can find it on Spotify or YouTube Music for example.

Eh, there's not much more to say about me, I try stuff out even if it's bad, which it is - in about 90% of cases, but why would I let that demotivate me?
